	<h2>music</h2>
	<p>back in mid 2023-mid 2024 i made music on bandlab under the alias <a href="https://www.bandlab.com/billisbored" target="_blank">billy</a></p>
	<p>(be warned that a lot of music on that page is awful, mostly due to my lack of creativity and that bandlab as a DAW is horrid.)</p>
	<p>i met a few good friends on there that i still talk to today, some still make music, and are way better then me, so go check them out. (look who im following if you wanna see those guys)</p>
	<p>i stopped because it was no longer fun to do, and the site (at least the part i was in) was dying.</p>
	<p><br>recently i got fl studio and a guitar and iâ€™ve been trying to get back into it. ive mostly just been using my guitar, trying to figure out music theory and allat.</p>
	<p><br>if i make some shtuff ill put it here</p>
