	<h2>why i made this</h2>
	<p>i made this site so i could keep track of myself</p>
	<p>hopefully you found it interesting</p>
	<p>maybe one person found this and thought it was really cool and was inspired to make their own (like me!)</p>
	<p>that would be super.</p>
	<p><br>if you don’t like it, or think its cringe, you’re welcome to leave :)</p>
