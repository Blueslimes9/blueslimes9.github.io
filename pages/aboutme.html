	<h2>about me</h2>
	<p>hello! my name is ben, i was born in late 2008 and am currently 16.</p>
	<p>i have no pets, two older brothers (one lives in florida), and a younger sister</p>
	<p>i grew up and live in the great state of maine, USA, which has its ups and downs.</p>
	<p>maine is one of the safest states, but the tourism here is heavy, and the infrastructure isnt really equipped to support it, traffic in the summer here is a nightmare.</p>
	<p>maine is generally pretty cold, which i prefer over being hot, and the winters here are very white.</p>
	<p><br>i went to a small ish elementary school, there were only around 18 people in my class.</p>
	<p>my elementary and jr high was combined into one school.</p>
	<p>when covid hit, (~6th grade) my mother changed jobs to become a teacher in a different school</p>
	<p>me and my sister had to tag along with her, so we switched schools.</p>
	<p>this school was even smaller then the first one, and i don’t really talk to the people from there anymore.</p>
	<p>everyone was very nice and it wasnt really that hard to fit in.</p>
	<p>eventually the pandemic ended and i was able to return to my old school.</p>
	<p>my town is lucky enough to have no high school, so i got to choose where i wanted to go in the nearby area, and the town pays for tuition.</p>
	<p>ofc i chose a collage prep private school :P hey, if you’re gonna pay for my tuition, you bet i'm going to some expensive one.</p>
	<p><br>and thats where i am today, i haven’t been alive for all that long in the grand scheme of things, and compared to others it is relatively boring.</p>
	<p><br>im also a cat person, dogs are ok, and i get that they are “mans best friend,” but i don’t think any dog can recreate that feeling when a cat crawls on to your lap and takes a eep, or atleast, i've never had that happen.<br>ㅤ</p>
